- This is a desktop banking app project for my fake bank: Strawberry Bank.                                                                                                                                                        
- It uses Java for the main code and Java Swing for the GUI.                                                                                                                                                
- It is still in the early version where I have created the Bank and Account Classes but not the GUI in it's entireity.
